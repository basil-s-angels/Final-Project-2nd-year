## Getting Started

Install all dependencies:

```bash
npm run install-all
```

This will install all dependencies in the root, client, and server directory!

Run the frontend:

```bash
cd client
```

then run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Run the backend:

```bash
cd server
```

then run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

You can now fetch from [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to perform requests and receive responses.
